## How to run

1. Clone the project
2. Install all the necessary packages in the root of the project:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

   ```shell

   Take a look at [`package.json`](./package.json) for the list of available

For the sake of size, the audio in these examples uses the `mp3` format. This
may cause the audio to be slightly desynchronized with the animation (The
displayed waveform remains correct). `wav` files don't have this issue and
are the recommended format when working with Motion Canvas.
